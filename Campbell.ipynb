Because of its reputation for quality and service, Campbell has a strong position in the regional market, but demand remains somewhat sensitive to price.  While evaluating the new models, Campbell's marketing consultant has come up with the following demand curves:\n","\\begin{align*}\n","\tTruckDemand & = 500 - 17 \\cdot \\frac{TruckPrice}{1,000} \\\\\n","\tWagonDemand & = 400 - 12 \\cdot \\frac{WagonPrice}{1,000}\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","The dealership's unit costs are $\\$20,000$ for trucks and $\\$25,000$ for wagons.  Each truck requires three hours of prep labor, and each wagon requires two hours of prep labor.  The current staff can supply 250 hours of labor.  Determine prices at which Campbell Motors can maximize the profit it generates from combined sales of trucks and wagons. For this exercise, both truck demand and wagon demand may assume non-integer values (i.e., you should not round demands in case you get fractional values).\n","\n","\n","**Optimal solution is $Truck Price = \\$26,049$ and $Wagon Price = \\$30,062$; optimal value (in thousands) is \\$544,505.**\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pOcTYFBlXN9T"},"source":["**Objective Function**\n","\n","$\\max t_d \\cdot (t_p -
